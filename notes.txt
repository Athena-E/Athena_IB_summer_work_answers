Question 3b

To determine the ratio of branch instructions to ALU operations that results in the 7-stage pipeline out-performing the 21-stage pipeline, we can compare the total time to complete $x$ number of ALU operations and $y$ number of BR operations for both pipelines.\\

For the 7-stage pipeline, the total time is given by:
\begin{align*}
   & 3(x-1) + 15(y-1) + 21 - 3 \\
   & = 3x + 15y - 12
\end{align*}
Similarly for the 21-stage pipeline, the total time is given by:
\begin{align*}
   & (x-1) + 17(y-1) + 21 - 3 \\
   & = x + 17y
\end{align*}
[insert intuition later]\\

We want to solve for a solution to the inequality:
\begin{align*}
  3x + 15y - 12 & < x + 17y \\
  y             & > x - 6
\end{align*}

This suggests that the minimum ratio of branch intructions to ALU operations that would result in the 7-stage pipeline out-performing the 21-stage pipeline is $2:7$.
